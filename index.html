    <p>I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on algorithms and networks, the roles they play in
        large-scale social and information systems, and their broader societal implications. My work has been supported
        by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation
        Fellowship, a Simons Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, and
        grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of the
        National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and
        Sciences.</p>

            In 2021 and 2022, Karen Levy and I taught a new course entitled Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO
            1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a
            range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.

                        prerequisites. To support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with
                        optional advanced sections.
